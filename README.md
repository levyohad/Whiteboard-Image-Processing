# Whiteboard-Image-Processing
This project is an image processing project, involving tools of traditional imgae processing and deep neural networks.

The idea was creating a tool to capture the text written in class and transcript it to a computer file, effortlessly.

To operate the tool properly, one must have a rectangular whiteboard, and good clear line of sight with the handwritten text. Once you run the code, you'll have to press "Start live straem", and the camera will capture the text. In this version, we haven't implemented yet a way to extract the transcription, and we leave it to future work.

This project was done as an educational assignment in the Digital-Image-Processing (DIP) course.

Hope you enjoy the tool and find it useful!
